As an analysis toolkit, it's designed to be flexible and provide a wide range of functionality so that the same tool can be used for a variety of tasks. Because of this, it can be a little overwhelming at first. In this notebook we will introduce some of the essential pandas functionality and list a few best practices that will make learning pandas easier as you go.\n",
