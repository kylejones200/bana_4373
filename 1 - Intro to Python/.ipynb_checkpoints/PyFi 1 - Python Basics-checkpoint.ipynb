    "Coding is a skill just like playing an instrument, cooking, or wood-carving. It takes practice to become proficient, especially to the point where you're making things that are pretty (continuing the comparison: the time needed to not just be flailing wildly at guitar strings, but instead making chords that fit together can literally be weeks or months just to reach basic proficiency). However, the key thing to remember is... all practice is good practice, and it's just software. You literally cannot harm your computer by writing bad python code that throws an error. You might accidentally shut it down by generating an infinite loop... but 'oh well, try again after it reboots.' **Be tenacious, practice a lot, and make cool things.** "

    "> (notably using whitespace indentation to delimit code blocks rather than curly brackets or keywords), and a syntax which \n",

    "\n",
    "* Python is a programming language that is optimized for readability by having minimal syntax.\n",
    "* Writing \"Pythonic\" code involves writing code that is more readable, for example, writing `for element in list` rather than `for i in range(len(list)):`. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Jupyter**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Jupyter Notebooks are environments that let you run snippets of code and see the results of executing those code snippets in real time.\n",
    "* They are great \"scratchpads\" or \"sandboxes\" for playing around with code, not for running code for production.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Types**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Lists are mutable data types that can store objects in sequence so that the elements can be accessed by index.\n",
    "* Tuples are immutable data types that can store objects in sequence - to change them, you would have to create a new tuple, rather than modifying them in place, since they are immutable.\n",
    "* Dictionaries allow you to store key-value pairs, so that you can then look up values by their keys. You can also iterate through dictionaries, but they are unordered.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conditional statements (and booleans)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Python contains the Boolean objects True and False as first class objects, meaning you can assign them to variables as in `a = True`, or even as in `a = x == 10`.\n",
    "* The syntax for only running certain code if a condition is true is: `if [Boolean variable/expression]:`\n",
    "* `if` statements can be extended to check additional conditions with `elif`. \n",
    "* `if` statements should always be closed with `else` conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Iterating**\n",
    "\n",
    "* `for` loops involve iterating over an iterable object - lists, tuples, and dictionaries are all iterable - and doing some operation on each object. \n",
    "* The syntax for `for` loops is `for element in list`, where `element` is an object that can then be referred to within the `for` loop."
