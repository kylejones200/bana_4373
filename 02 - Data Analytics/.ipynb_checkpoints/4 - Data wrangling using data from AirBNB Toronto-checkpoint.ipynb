Excel can do some of this but one limitation to Excel is that there is no audit trail for the transformations that have been applied to the data. This can lead to issues with reproducing the results later. It also leads to \"magic numbers\" which are values like `40` or `120` that appear in calculations but have no clear origin - they appear like magic and are hard to traceback to an origin. \n",
