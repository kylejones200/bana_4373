Here are a few recommendations on curricula for learning Python (some of these are free and some require a subscription or payment).

1. [LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/) (formerly Lynda.com): The single largest repository of useful Python and business analytics classes. I have taken many of these (more than 85 courses) and I like the quality, pace, and presentation style. Examples
    1. [Become a Python developer](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/paths/become-a-python-developer)
    2. [Learn Python for Data Science](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/paths/master-python-for-data-science)
2. [EdX](https://www.edx.org/), [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/), and [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/): All three offer good classes in MOOC format. You can audit the class for free or pay for a certificate of completion. Many of these are more theory than practice. Examples:
    1. [Harvard CS50](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science)
    2. [MIT Intro to Computer Science with Python](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-7)
3. [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/) and Codecadamy: These offer the best blend of interactivity and presentation. You can write your code in the browser and get immediate feedback. They are also the most expensive.

The best way to learn python is to use it for something. Having a goal gives the motivation for actually caring about things like data types. Two places to find interested projects to work on:

* Pinterest: Search for python and you can get lots of free books and project tutorials
* Medium.com: lots of high quality, step by step tutorials for projects. The best part about Medium is that you create something each time like a program that can [identify people](https://medium.com/deepvisionguru/how-to-embed-detectron2-in-your-computer-vision-project-817f29149461) in images or an [interactive dashboard](https://medium.com/better-programming/build-an-interactive-modern-dashboard-using-dash-ab6b34cb515).
