# # Summary
# 
# Python can work with PDF documents to: extract data, extract tables, remove pages, or merge documents. The Python library that is most often used for analysis is called PyPDF2.
# 
# After completing this tutorial, you will know:
# * How to use Pandas DataFrames to open \*.csv and \*.xlsx files
# * How to apply functions to DataFrames to calcuate the mean and standard deviation
# * How to make basic plots

        for page in range(pdf_read_object.numPages):
            pdf_write_object.addPage(pdf_read_object.getPage(page))

    final_file_object = open(output, 'wb')

    final_file_object.close()

    pathlist = Path(input_folder).glob('*.pdf')

    pdfs = [str(i) for i in pathlist]
